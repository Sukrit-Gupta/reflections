When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    One big reason is for collaboration with other people.
    Other reason is to make your code's source open.
    It gives you an easy way to view your repository on some other computer, and no need of setting up some server.
    For private repositories, the above reason is also valid.
